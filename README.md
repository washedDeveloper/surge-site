this is my first time using Surge for deploying a static site.

idk really why but whatever.
i was curious.


anyhow...

how to deploy the site

1. npm run login -> (just put your email and a password if you don't have an account)
2. npm run deploy -> deploys the site to wehavebigswag.surge.sh

yeah kinda cool

probably the fastest way to deploy

:)
